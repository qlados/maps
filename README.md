This repositories contains various maps that I, qlados (also known as Valkyh), made for PGM (https://pgm.dev/).

More generally every map in this repository SHOULD work with the Minecraft 1.8 PGM Plugin, maintained by Electroid (https://github.com/Electroid/PGM).

If you encounter any bugs contact me via Discord, my tag is Valky#2870.

Cheers.
