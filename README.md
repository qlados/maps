This repositories contains various maps that I, qlados (also known as Valky), made for PGM.

More generally every map in this repository should work with the Minecraft 1.8 PGM Plugin. For more information on PGM check https://pgm.dev/.

If you encounter any bugs using these maps create an issue.

Cheers.
